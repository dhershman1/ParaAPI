# ParaAPI
> ParaAPI is a fully Modular Driven system that alone, does very little however once modules are plugged in they can use ParaAPI to run certain data, and build data requests simply and easily all while maintaining a very low performance hit, and memory usage. 

Each module is a simple small JavaScript Class which runs off ParaAPI's Config & Data files they use the same systems to build into these files allowing easy viewing of large amounts of data.

Each Chat & Death is built in a separate instance of each other to avoid overflow and conflicts then ran through ParaAPI in it's own instance before being returned with new data to the correct instances.

## Terms of using ParaAPI: 
---
Using ParaAPI is obviously free and it will ALWAYS be free. You can use ANY Module And ANY part of ParaAPI in your own plugins/mods and you can work your plugins to use ParaAPI if you would like as well. I just ask for a little bit of recognition in the end, Since ParaAPI is a dependency make sure users know if you build a module they will need to use ParaAPI on their server as well.
